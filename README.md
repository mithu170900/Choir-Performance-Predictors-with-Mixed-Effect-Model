We created a logit link mixed-effect model with fixed effects and used the package brm() in R.
It is a function provided by the rstanarm and brms packages in R, which is used for fitting generalized linear
mixed-effects models (GLMMs) using the Stan probabilistic programming language. brm() specifically fits
GLMMs using a Bayesian framework, which allows for the estimation of posterior distributions of model
parameters and the function fits in the model by using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling
methods implemented in Stan to estimate the posterior distribution.
